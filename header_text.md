# Philly COVID Stats
This website shows a visualization of Philly's [publicly available](https://www.opendataphilly.org/showcase/philadelphia-covid-19-information) COVID data, updated daily.
The colored bars on the plots are based on the city's [COVID Response Levels](https://www.phila.gov/2022-02-16-philadelphia-establishes-covid-response-levels-to-guide-mandate-enforcement/) as published on February 16, 2022.
Be sure to read the notes at the bottom for disclaimers and details about the data, the most important of which is to not trust the numbers reported for the current day.
